## install

Add the following to your `Cargo.toml` file

```toml
[dependencies]
json_env_logger = "0.1"
```

## usage

### basic use

Like `env_logger`, call `init` before you start logging.

```rust
fn main() {
    json_env_logger::init();

    log::info!("üëã")
}
```

Run your program with `RUST_LOG=info your/bin`

### adding more structure

The `log` crate is working its way towards adding first class interfaces for structured fields
in its macros. `json_env_logger` will serialize them when present. Sadly the `log` crate
doesn't expose these macro interfaces quite yet. ...But `kv-log-macro` does!

```toml
[dependencies]
json_env_logger = "0.1"
kv-log-macro = "1.0"
```

```rust
fn main() {
    json_env_logger::init();

    log::info!("üëã", { size: "medium", age: 42 })
}
```

> ‚≠ê These structures fields can are currently limited for now to the types `u64`, `i64`, `f64`, `bool`, `char` and `str`

Run your program with `RUST_LOG=info your/bin`

### iso-timestamps

By default json env logger uses unix epoch time for timestamps. You might prefer
ISO-8601 timestamps instead. You can swap implementations with by enabling the `iso-timestamps` feature

```toml
[dependencies]
json_env_logger = { version = "0.1", features = ["iso-timestamps"] }
```

```rust
fn main() {
    json_env_logger::init();

    log::info!("üëã")
}
```

Run your program with `RUST_LOG=info your/bin`

### panic visibility

When panics are unavoidable you can register a panic hook that serializes the panic to json before logging it with `error!`

```rust
fn main() {
    json_env_logger::init();
    json_env_logger::panic_hook();

    panic!("whoooops!")
}
```

Run your program with `RUST_LOG=info your/bin`

> ‚≠ê You can also serialize backtraces by enabling the `backtrace` cargo feature

## faq

<details><summary>Why do I need structured logging?</summary>
<p>

Maybe you don't. ...But maybe you do! You might if you run applications in production that in an environment whose log aggregation does useful things
for you if you emit json logs such as

  - structured field based filters, an alternative to artisanal regex queries
  - aggregation statistics 
  - alerting automation
  - anomaly detection
  - basically anything a computer can do for you when its able logs are structured in a machine readable format

 <details><summary>What use case does `json_env_logger` target?</summary>
<p>
Most folks Rust logging market start out with `log`. They soon find they need configurable logging so they move to `env_logger`. Sometimes they want `env_logger` but pretty logging for host local application so they move to `pretty_env_logger`.

In other cases you want to run applications in a cloud service that reward you for emitting logs in JSON format. That's use case this targets, those coming from `env_logger` but would like to leverage build in JSON log parsing and discovery options their cloud provided offers for free. That's the use case `json_env_logger` targets.

 <details><summary>Does one of these already exist?</summary>
<p>

Yes. Like the Rust ecosystem, they are all good. Picking a dependencies is a dance of picking your tradeoffs.

There's [`slog`](https://github.com/slog-rs/slog), an entire ecosystem of logging for Rust. It's strength is that its highly configurable. It's drawback is that it's highly configurable interface can get into the way of simple cases where you just want to emit structured logs in json without a lot of setup.

Here's an example from its [docs](https://docs.rs/slog-json/2.3.0/slog_json/)

```rust
#[macro_use]
extern crate slog;
extern crate slog_json;

use slog::Drain;
use std::sync::Mutex;

fn main() {
    let root = slog::Logger::root(
        Mutex::new(slog_json::Json::default(std::io::stderr())).map(slog::Fuse),
        o!("version" => env!("CARGO_PKG_VERSION"))
    );
}
```

vs

```rust
fn main() {
    json_env_logger::init();
}
```

There's also [`femme`](https://github.com/lrlna/femme/) which is one part a pretty printer, one part JSON logger, and one part WASM JS object logger. It's strength is that is indeed pretty! It's not _just_ pretty logger and yet also not _just_ a JSON logger. It's a assortment of things making it broadly focused rather than narrowly focused on JSON log formatting. If you only use one of those things you might be packing more than you need. If you are migrating from `env_logger`'s environment variable driving configuration options you are a bit out of luck. You will be finding yourself recompiling and rebuilding your application to change log levels.

 <details><summary>so what's are the tradeoffs of `json_env_logger` then?</summary>
<p>

Glad you asked. `env_logger` has some opinion defaults, some of which you might not like. An example, it logs to stderr by default. You might play for team stdout. The good news is that json_env_logger exposes its interfaces for overriding those opinions. 

Some features of `env_logger` `json_env_logger` doesn't use and those bring in extra transitive dependencies. We're aware. Luckily they are all behind `env_logger` feature flags and `json_env_logger` turns them all off! The only transient dependency is then just `log` which you already have :)

 That's not technically a question but ok. Ask away by opening a GitHub issue. Thanks!
